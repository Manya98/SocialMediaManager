# SocialMediaManager
An agentic AI social media manager uses Python frameworks like LangChain or CrewAI to autonomously research topics, draft, review, and schedule posts across platforms. Using LLMs, these agents analyze trends and create content, often featuring a human-in-the-loop for final approval before API publication.
